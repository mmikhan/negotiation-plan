  ABSTRACT = {Software-defined wireless sensor networking (SDWSN) is an emerging networking architecture which is envisioned to become the main enabler for the internet of things (IoT). In this architecture, the sensors plane is managed by a control plane. With this separation, the network management is facilitated, and performance is improved in dynamic environments. One of the main issues a sensor environment is facing is the limited lifetime of network devices influenced by high levels of energy consumption. The current work proposes a system design which aims to improve the energy efficiency in an SDWSN by combining the concepts of content awareness and adaptive data broadcast. The purpose is to increase the sensors&rsquo; lifespan by reducing the number of generated data packets in the resource-constrained sensors plane of the network. The system has a distributed management approach, with content awareness being implemented at the individual programmable sensor level and the adaptive data broadcast being performed in the control plane. Several simulations were run on historical weather and the results show a significant decrease in network traffic. Compared to similar work in this area which focuses on improving energy efficiency with complex algorithms for routing, clustering, or caching, the current proposal employs simple computing procedures on each network device with a high impact on the overall network performance.},

  ABSTRACT = {Presently, the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)-related technologies in the Smart Farming domain is rapidly emerging. The ultimate goal is to collect, monitor, and effectively employ relevant data for agricultural processes, with the purpose of achieving an optimized and more environmentally sustainable agriculture. In this paper, a low-cost, modular, and Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN)-based IoT platform, denoted as &ldquo;LoRaWAN-based Smart Farming Modular IoT Architecture&rdquo; (LoRaFarM), and aimed at improving the management of generic farms in a highly customizable way, is presented. The platform, built around a core middleware, is easily extensible with ad-hoc low-level modules (feeding the middleware with data coming from the sensors deployed in the farm) or high-level modules (providing advanced functionalities to the farmer). The proposed platform has been evaluated in a real farm in Italy, collecting environmental data (air/soil temperature and humidity) related to the growth of farm products (namely grapes and greenhouse vegetables) over a period of three months. A web-based visualization tool for the collected data is also presented, to validate the LoRaFarM architecture.},
